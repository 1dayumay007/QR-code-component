## Layout

Specifying the minimum and maximum widths for mobile and desktop views helps ensure consistent responsiveness and layout across different screen sizes.

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

## Colors

Defining the hexadecimal values for each color provides a more detailed and precise representation of the desired color palette.

- White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
- Light gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
- Grayish blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%)
- Dark blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%)

## Typography

Specifying the font size for headings and subheadings would enhance the hierarchy and visual balance of the text.

Providing examples of how to apply the font styles to different elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons, would make the guide more practical.
