## Overview

My first challenge, so used some help from YouTube to get to this final result ðŸ˜Š

## My process

The process was watching YouTuber Thomas Sankara code the solution and me repeating after him in my IDE.
This is I believe the way how i will eventually acquire the ability to code those solutions myself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (:root {})
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- a "CSS reset" or a "global reset."
- linking google fonts
- linking style sheets
- target="\_blank" open new tab in browser (if added after link anchor)
- media queries

### Some code snippets I am proud of

```html
<a
        href="https://app.netlify.com/teams/1dayumay007/overview"
        target="_blank"
        >Juraj Slovinsky</a

```

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

@media (min-width: 500px) {
  .container {
    width: 400px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to now focus on coding more HTML and CSS Challenges to become skilled in order to create my own portfolio website for example.
First of all be independent, which means to code a project without help from YouTube or other resource.
And also work on styled components and media queries.
Get comfortable with HTML and CSS basically.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM) - This helped me to code the solution. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This is an amazing page which helped me implement the fonts. I'd recommend it to everyone.
